## Description
Material Design is a specification for a unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices. Our goal is to deliver a lean, lightweight set of AngularJS-native UI elements that implement the material design specification for use in AngularJS single-page applications (SPAs).

Note: only the minimum set of files necessary to support the OpenThread project are included here.
