## Description

`wpantund` is a user-space network interface driver/daemon that
provides a native IPv6 network interface to a low-power wireless
**Network Co-Processor** (or *NCP*). It was written and developed by
Nest Labs to make supporting [Thread](http://threadgroup.org)
connectivity on Unix-like operating systems more straightforward.

`wpantund` is designed to marshall all access to the NCP, ensuring
that it always remains in a consistent and well-defined state.

This is not an official Google product.
